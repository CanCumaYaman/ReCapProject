# ReCapProject
We can do crud operations and some other operations for car,brand,color,user,customer and rental. I used sql server and used foreign key for relation between this tables. We can rent a car with this system. 

When I made this app, I used layered architecture . Layers are Entity, DataAcces, Business, Core(same codes all project) and I used Console for UI. I used Web Api and tested this in Postman.
I used entity framework to ORM.
I also added autofac for IoC, fluent validation for cross cutting concerns and AOP.
